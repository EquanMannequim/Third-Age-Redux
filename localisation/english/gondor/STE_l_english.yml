 STE.1.t:0 "The Fall of Numenor"
 STE.1.d:0 "During the Second Age Numenor was the most powerful nation on Arda. But at the height of it's power many of the peoples of Numenor became corrupted by the dark powers of Sauron. A rift formed between the faithful Numenorians and those of the King's Men faction. Seven ships of the faithful led by Elendil fled Numenor leading to the formation of the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor. Before the island was even out of sight Eru in his almighty power struck down the island Kingdom and sunk it below the waves. Now all that remains of the Great Island of Numenor is the tip of Menatarma."
 STE.2.t:0 "The Death of Isildur"
 STE.2.d:0 "Less than a decade after the War of The Last Alliance High King Isildur and his guard were ambushed upon the Gladden Fields by a groups of rogue Orcs ten times their number. Although they fought hard Isildurs oldest sons were killed on the field leaving him with no other option than to flee across the Anduin where he was slain by Orc archers."
 STE.3.t:0 "The Time of Stewards"
 STE.3.d:0 "After the fall of the last King of Gondor to the hands of the Witch King, Mardil Voronwë took charge of Gondor and Steward and leader of the Kingdom until a time where a member of the Royal Line appeared to take the throne once again. \n\nThe year is T.A 3015 and TEN CENTURIES have passed since Mardil took charge of Gondor. Denethor II now leads the Kingdom as ruling Stewards as the threat of Mordor rises and evils of Middle Earth continue to grow stronger. But hope remains in Boromir the eldest son of Denethor for he is of noble make and may lead the Kingdom to greatness one day."
 STE.4.t:0 "The Andrast Situation"
 STE.4.d:0 "At the far edges of the Kingdom lies the Fiefdom of Andrast. Though never fully colonized by those of Dunedain decent the area known as Andrast has long been under Gondorian influence. \n\n Now it is time they were reintegrated into the Kingdom once again whether as a distant fiefdom or controlled directly from Minas Tirith."
 STE.5.t:0 "The Fall of Minas Ithil"
 STE.5.d:0 "The Principality of Ithilian has never truly recovered from the fall of Minas Ithil. Every year the orc raids become worse and more people flee the region. \n\n If Faramir is to hold the region with his rangers he will need more soldiers and equipment but every day wasted trying to stop the inevitable may leave Gondor more vulnurable."

 STE.6.d:0 ""
 STE.7.t:0 "Gondor Needs A King"
 STE.7.d:0 "Word of Aragorns deeds have reached Minas Tirith and Gondor has called forth Aragorn to take his rightful place as King of the Southern Kingdom. If he leaves now he may be able to reach Gondor by Winter and help fortify the South against the threat of Mordor."
