 MRD.1.t:0 "The End Of The Second Age"
 MRD.1.d:0 "In S.A 3261 the armies of Numenor marched upon the Black gate might as they were not even the hordes of Mordor dared face them in open combat. Sauron realizing he could not defeat the Númenóreans allowed himself to be captured, and begged falsely for mercy. The Númenóreans brought him back to their island as a prisoner. \n\n After coming to Numenor Sauron slowly rose the ranks before becoming advisor to King Ar-Pharazôn decades had passed but Saurons influece upon the king had corrupted many of the Numenorians into hating and the Valar and Eru himself. In S.A 3319 The King under Saurons influence struck out of Numenor in an attmept to invade Valinor.  Manwë, chief of the Valar, thus called upon Ilúvatar, who opened a massive chasm in the sea between Númenor and Aman that swallowed the Great Armament of Ar-Pharazôn. Númenor was drowned by a great wave and sank into the abyss, killing its inhabitants, including the body of Sauron, which robbed him his ability to assume fair forms ever after."
 MRD.2.t:0 "The Attack On Dol Guldor"
 MRD.2.d:0 "In T.A 1000 Sauron returned to Arda at the fortress of Dol Guldor where he became known as the Necromancer and slowly regained his strength. The Council of the Wise long feared the Necromancer might indeed be Sauron and in the year T.A 2941, the council finally agreed to attack Dol Guldur, During the battle Sauron was forced to flee the fortress back to Mordor where his armies where already preparing awaiting the return of the Dark Lord."
 MRD.3.t:0 "The Nine Rings Of Men"
 MRD.3.d:0 ""Nine he gave to Mortal Men, proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago they fell under the dominion of the One, and they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who knows? As the Shadow grows once more, they too may walk again."- Gandalf \n \n Saurons most loyal and powerful Servants The Nine Nazgûl re-emerged around 1300 of the Third Age, as Sauron at long last began to take shape lead by the Witch King of Angmar they are Saurons most loyal generals and hunters."
