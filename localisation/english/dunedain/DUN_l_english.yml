Petty wars between brothers soon raged as the strength of the Northern Kingdom faltered."

Still Angmar was repelled from Fornost and was for a time subdued by reinforcements from Lindon and Lothlórien. \n\nHowever, the North Kingdom's strength continued to dwindle, and in T.A 1974 the end came; Annuminas was abandoned and the new capital in Fornost was captured by Angmar and with that last defeat The Kingdom of Arnor fell.
